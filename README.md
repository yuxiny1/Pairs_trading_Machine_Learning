Final Year project
Final year project proposal 
By xinyi yu 

Beginning 

I personally have some experience in the field of finance, and I was studying AI, machine learning influence, and neural networks last year. During the conversation between me and my supervisor Nikolay Nikolov, discussed a lot about neural networks, the financial world, and machine learning. It is the first-time pairs trading comes up to mind. I spent my weekend days doing some research on the field of pairs trading and neural network, and I become interested in this field. In this project, I will mainly focus on the two companies Pepsi and Coca-Cola. The project will measure the efficiency and accuracy of adapting linear regression and multiple layer perceptrons, increasing the accuracy of neural networks and presenting the result plus the project.

Aims and objectives:

The project is aimed to improve and simplify the efficiency of linear regression and multiple-layer perceptrons, resulting in increasing accuracy and decreasing loss rate. The project is going to help investors to understand the fundamental of pairs trading, and how to use this approach to higher the possibility of being profitable.  Using machine learning, natural network to use pairs trading. 

Measurable achievements 

Simulate transactions and predict the next price converge in the next whole year or half year.
-measure the success rate of adapting this neural network algorithm.

As we all know that computing power, algorithm, and data are three major factors in machine learning.  Data sets and computing power are growing over time. Hence, investors are motivated to use the algorithm every time when they are equipped with a new data set or updated computing power. It is like the self-driving vehicle problem.

Personal motivation learns from the project

Through the process the details of technology of machine learning, neural networks, linear regression, multiple layers perceptron’s and time series, and most importantly how to use those new tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of solving a real-world financial problem.

I will demonstrate the whole project by using examples of historical data. In the demonstration, you will see the accuracy rate and error rate of the prediction. Furthermore, I will demonstrate the comparison between my methodology and other researchers’ result. The comparison will prove the efficiency of my methodology in these circumstances. 

How to demonstrate 

Many projects visualize their data and result, comparing the data we are given and predicting the outcome of already existing trading data. It is straightforward to get the result if investors already have the data, and we could compare the predictions. 


Background research

Worth doing and work overview 

Pairs trading is popular due to its simple approach and effectiveness. According to miltonfmr.com, the strategy is profitable in most years. They get the highest return in 2020 with 186.4%.  Pairs trading’s core is market-neutral, which means that the performance of the overall market doesn’t for the strategy because it will only trade between two highly correlated companies. 

Moreover, Yale Business school economists Even G. Gates, William Goetzmann, and K. Gerry Rouwenhorst used a large set of data from 1967 to 1997 to prove that this strategy is profitable at a +12% return. Furthermore, they adapted the conservative estimates of transaction costs with randomly selected pairs.

Generally, pair trading is a trading strategy to solve real-world financial problems among companies. Nonetheless, no strategy fits the solution itself, a tool used by different people to create various results. The aim of this project is trying to use highly advanced modern tools to solve existing problems.

The financial world is much about uncertainty everywhere, and one comparative advantage of pairs trading is that the method limited the uncertainty of the market into two companies at a macro level. In the traditional method, investors have to take into consideration the bear market period, the bull market period, and the whole life cycle of a company or an industry. Furthermore, for the competition on a global level, government regulation, and the global market is influencing the judgement of investors.  Pairs trading simplifies the whole trading process into two correlated companies in a traditional industry.  

Methodology & techniques explanation

Pairs trading is a Python application, which predicts the true prices of two given specific companies based on historical price data. The application implements model training for Linear regression, Multiple layer perceptron, and machine learning algorithms. The application uses a variety of techniques including Data mining, machine learning, Neural networks and Data visualization.

Pairs trading using Linear regression, Multiple layers perceptron, and time series.

At a high level, pairs trading is talking about investors’ trade decisions made depending on the methodology implemented. The methodology is using algorithms to search valuable data in the history, and historical trade price data of two companies, gluing those valuable data, and converting data into business insights, resulting in helping the company make trade decisions in a certain period of time with expected investment return. 

How could we use an algorithm to determine which data is more meaningful than others? 

Firstly, we use statistics mainly as our language to interpret our understanding of the data. Secondly, the searching part of the algorithm that we used to go through different weights and many layers of nodes, and how we got feedback from those errors and influenced our weights and parameters. The efficiency of the algorithm we used is based on computer science and the level of understanding of how computer work and the effectiveness of the algorithm will depend on understanding the fundamental of trading activities.

Furthermore, our understanding of data is based on our value and weights of important factors that will have an impact on the data, and basically, this is a comparatively complex and subjective subject. For example, the weight of different elements will have a different effect on the result of our prediction. The fundamental reason is that we could justify history from all different perspectives, and it is essentially hard to statistically judge the correctness from different perspectives. 

No man has a Time Machine to go back to the period to recheck all the elements, finding out the elements leading to a price fluctuation in the shorter, or investors could not calculate all the elements that will influence the price even if they have the Time Machine. To illustrate, the famous Warrant Buffet said, In the short term, a market is a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine.
 
It turns out, investors may not necessarily understand all the relevant elements to predict the price. Investors could focus on the correlation between the two companies to make trade decisions. However, investors could approach mathematics and statistics as a language to precisely adjust the weights and number of layers of the algorithm, resulting in understanding the correlation of the companies in a big way.

Moreover, the tool will use a linear regression trading algorithm, implemented with time series according to the research. The trading decision process is partially dependent on the historical data of the two companies due to the nature of the financial world. For example, the correlation between the current stock price of a company is weak with the stock price of a company 10 years ago. However, the stock price of the most recent is relatively significant to investors. That’s the reason we need to implement time series to solve this problem properly. There are many methods to use time series.

What new skills do you need to acquire 

The trading algorithm, time series, linear regression, and multiple layers perceptron are the main skills I need to acquire. We have studied the python library in the module of programming with data, and the data structure of algorithms 1&2. I will learn a lot from the course on artificial intelligence, and online materials including, udemy’s course “deep learning”. Books including, 2017-08-16 Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Ed.

The knowledge I can apply and have acquired from experience outside of this degree is my first degree Master of Professional Accounting. I will use some financial knowledge to understand investors’ positions better. I could use my knowledge of understanding about the financial report to make parameters and weights of the project.

Identify a gap

Humans use new tools to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their work. This project will mainly adopt linear regression and multiple-layer perceptron. As well-known, there are three main drivers in the field of AI, computing power, algorithm, and data. The world of the environment is rapidly changing and evolving at a remarkable speed, investors could recognise the gap in this kind of environment. The project will discuss the methods investors used to deal with the problem of pairs trading in a traditional way, trying to improve them by using new tools according to my understanding of mine. Estimate and evaluate the influence on the performance of the project and explain the details of the project will be done. 


Existing Knowledge


Pairs trading is taking a long position in the undervalued asset and a short position in the overvalued asset unit the equilibrium is reached again. For example, Ford and Volkswagen. The advantage of the strategy at a high-level explanation is isolating a larger part of the uncertainty from a macro perspective. Traditionally, if investors purchase GM stock, the trade decisions contain multiple layers of hidden decisions: 1 investor are bullish on the world economy; 2 investors are bullish on the U.S economy; 3 investors are bullish on the U.S economy; 4 investors are bullish on the U.S. auto industry; 5 in the U.S auto industry; lastly, investors are bullish on GM. In this series of judgments, investors could be made the wrong decision all the way to buy GM if one of them is wrong. 

Consequently, traders could change their strategy through this method. Trading at the same time, one General Motors, one American Ford, and traders buy both stocks. Consequently, traders could long one company and short the other at the same time. In this way, traders don’t require to consider multiple layers of complexity, including, the world economy, the U.S economy, and the U.S. auto industry. These factors cancel each other out into long and short strategy structures, therefore there is only one factor to consider: 

which company will be better, GM or Ford? Then investors should long the one trader judge and short the other.  



Correlation between chosen companies

The correlation between the two companies is the main metric for investors' decisions. The process of determining which company is outperforming is rather complex. However, it could be done through data dimensionality reduction with the association. 

Pair trading is actually one of the “hedging” strategies many financial companies are adopting. Investors will find that it is a prognostic way to draw out limited uncertainty from the infinite uncertainty of the market, turns the original many options into only two options, and then train the accuracy and loss rate of the neural network.


Many projects research is related to my project because people are smart at using new tools to make money, especially in this data-driven industry. I will engage critically with existing work because it is an efficient experiment, and the result will be shown by data. Pairs trading is related to another trading strategy called high-frequency trading. However, this paper will not discuss many high-frequency trading algorithms. Those are two different solutions to the financial world problem investors are equipped with the opportunity to use more tools to beat the market.
